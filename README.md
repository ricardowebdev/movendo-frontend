# A simple Rental company of movies

<span>
  I've made this project using react, following the course that i did in 2022, the main idea it's just to simulate a rental company of movies.
  Where the maintainer can add new movies, manager the customers and also make the rentals, and the user can login view the amount of movies, 
  edit your profile and also make rents for himself<br /><br />
